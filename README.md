This website serves as a sandbox project for me to learn web development. Eventually, once life settles down a little, I'll use this site to show off some of my music, fitness advice, etc. But for now it's only here to show that I can do a little HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I started this website tonight based on the example I found at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp. I found HTML and CSS fairly intuitive and straightforward (especially after doing C# application design over the summer) so I was able to modify it a lot in just a few hours. Currently, it's based on nin.com - I figured a good way to start learning was to try figuring out how to copy a website instead of just following a step by step guide. Soon, I'll make it into something original.
